# SkyOS  
SkyOS is an "Operating System" designed for pocket computers. (However, a better classification would be a GUI)  
It attempts to mimic Android, and Android features (SkyStore as Playstore, etc)  
  
## Installation  
To install SkyOS, you should use the installer script hosted on SkyDocs, along with the `requirements.json` file in this repository.  
The command to do so would be  
`wget run https://skydocs.madefor.cc/scripts/installer.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyTheCodeMaster/SkyOS/master/requirements.json`  
## Usage  
As of writing this, there's no way to get programs on and off, as SkyOS is in extreme alpha.  
You can press `E` to exit to a shell, where it's a normal CraftOS shell.  
## Customization  
To customize the graphics of SkyOS (The only customizable part right now), the files located inside of the `/graphics/` folder need to be opened in `skimgEditor`.  
Make sure each of files maintain the same resolution (`26x1` for the bars), or else the images inside SkyOS won't display correctly.
